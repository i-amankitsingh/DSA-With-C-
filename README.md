Problem 1:
Container With Most Water:-
Problem Statement
You are given an array of non-negative integers, where each element represents the height of a vertical line drawn at that index. The width between any two lines is 1.
Find two lines such that, together with the x-axis, they form a container that holds the most water. Return the indices of these two lines.

Index:  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
Height: 1   8   6   2   5   4   8   3   7

Each number represents the height of a vertical line. The goal is to select two lines that maximize the area of water they can contain. For example:

If you choose the lines at indices 1 and 8 (heights 8 and 7), the container width is 
8 − 1 = 7
8−1=7 and the height is 
min (8,7)=7.
Area = 7 × 7 = 49
